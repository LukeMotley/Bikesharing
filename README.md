# Bikesharing

## Overview:
This project takes NYC bike data and uses visualizations created using Tableau to analyze the viablity of bikesharing companies in other cities. The data used was gathered in August 2019.

## Results:
* There were more than 2.3 million rides in August of 2019
* As seen on the map below, most bikes are rented in the lower half of the Manhattan borrow.

* Looking at the below graph, optimal times for bike maintance are between 2-5 AM.
* Highest use times
  * 8-9 AM (Perhaps people going to work)
  * 4-7 PM (Perhaps once people are off work)

* The majority of bike rides are less than 40 min long.
* Further shown here, prime times for bike rentals are in the morning and evening, before and after work.
* Men rent bikes far more then women do.

## Summary:

From all this data, there are a number of key points that present themselves. Popular times for bike rentals seem to be typical times when people are awake and not at work, so in the morning and evening. More men rent bikes than women as well. Almost all bike rides are rented for less than an hour long.


Some more visualizations that would aid in the exploration of bikesharing viablity in other cities would be :
* Check the same metrics across different months of the year.
* If more data could be utalized, data for different borrows could be used to compare populations and rides to explore whether the relationship between population and rides are purely linear.
